Project Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced fraud detection system for credit card transactions using ensemble learning techniques. The objective is to build models that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions from a dataset of credit card transactions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: Credit Card Fraud Detection. It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset includes:

Time: Elapsed time in seconds from the first transaction.
V1-V28: Principal components obtained with PCA to protect user identities and sensitive information.
Amount: Transaction amount.
Class: Target variable (0 for legitimate transactions, 1 for fraudulent transactions).
Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost
Usage
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
Open notebook.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Follow the steps in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, train models, and evaluate their performance.
Data Preprocessing
In this section, we handle missing values, standardize features, and split the dataset into training and testing sets. The relevant code is:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('creditcard.csv')

# Handle missing values and standardize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
data['Normalized Amount'] = scaler.fit_transform(data['Amount'].values.reshape(-1, 1))

# Split the dataset
X = data.drop(['Class'], axis=1)
y = data['Class']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
Feature Engineering
This project primarily uses the PCA-transformed features (V1-V28) along with the normalized transaction amount to train the models.

Model Training
We implemented various ensemble models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost to detect fraudulent transactions. Below is an example of how the Random Forest model is trained:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Train Random Forest model
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50, max_depth=10, n_jobs=-1, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Here's how the evaluation for the Random Forest model is conducted:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Predictions and evaluation
rf_preds = rf_model.predict(X_test)
print("Random Forest Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, rf_preds))
print(classification_report(y_test, rf_preds))
Results
The performance metrics for each model were recorded and compared to identify the best performing model. The results showed that XGBoost provided the highest accuracy, precision, and recall for detecting fraudulent transactions.

Conclusion
The developed fraud detection system demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble learning techniques in identifying fraudulent transactions. The models were able to achieve satisfactory results, indicating their potential use in real-world applications.

Future Work
Future enhancements could include:

Implementing hyperparameter tuning to further improve model performance.
Exploring deep learning techniques for fraud detection.
Developing a real-time fraud detection system for credit card transactions.
