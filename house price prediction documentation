Lot Area
Year Built
Neighborhood
Total Basement Area
Garage Type
Sale Price (Target Variable)
Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
XGBoost (optional for advanced modeling)
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
Installation Instructions
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can create a virtual environment and install the necessary libraries using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost

How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook notebooks/house_price_prediction.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code and make predictions.

Steps and Implementation
Step 1: Data Exploration
Load the dataset and explore its structure.
Check for missing values and data types.
Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values using median for numerical features and a placeholder for categorical features.
Identify categorical and numerical columns.
Step 3: Feature Engineering
Create new features (e.g., Total Square Footage) to improve model performance.
Step 4: Train-Test Split
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Step 5: Model Training
Train multiple regression models, including Gradient Boosting and Random Forest.
Optimize model hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
Step 6: Model Evaluation
Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
Visualize predictions versus actual values.
Step 7: Save the Model
Save the trained model for future predictions.
Results
Include your results here, showcasing your model's performance and possibly include visualizations (like scatter plots of actual vs. predicted prices) to help interpret the results.
